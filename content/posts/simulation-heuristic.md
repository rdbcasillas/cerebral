## Transcript
>Humans,  the only animal among 8.7 million species of animals on this planet, that can imagine. Our ability to look up the past and make up the future,  gives us an amazing power to manage and control the world around us. 

>But as the old saying goes, with great powers comes great responsibility and sadly, we can be quite irresponsible with this power of imagination. In fact, if left rampant, this great power can also become one of our greatest weaknesses. 

>In this episode of Cerebral, we will explore simulation heuristic, a mental shortcut that we use to think about the likelihood of something happening in the world based solely on how easy it is to imagine. 

>Ok, so that was a little too dramatic. Let’s get back to talking normally. 

>So, what is simulation? It’s a word we often hear in scientific contexts.
  >Biologists use simulation to model the behavior of animal populations or model the spread of a virus. Physicists use them to study everything from the delicate movement of atoms to awesome interactions between galaxies and black holes. And Economists use simulation to study markets  and human behavior.  In all these domains, scientists try to model real or hypothetical scenarios, to understand them using computers.

>But computers weren’t the first objects that allowed us the ability to perform simulation. Human brain is the oldest simulation technology made by nature itself. Our mental simulations may not be as reliable as computer simulations, but without this unreliable tool, there won’t be any computers.  

>Every single day, as soon as we wake up, without fail our mind starts simulating events that either happened in the past or  may happen in future.  When you indulge in a fantasy, of your own or created by somebody else, you are  running a simulation inside your mind.  Simulations help us make better plans by running multiple mental movies of different possibilities that can happen in future. Simulations allow us to be creative by helping us find innovative solutions to hard problems.  And simulations even helps us with empathizing with other people by simulating their mental states like joy or sadness within our own minds!


>So we can’t really function in this world without creating simulations.  Obviously, some simulations are more “realistic” than others and those are the ones that usually have more emotional impact on us. You can of course simulate the fantasy of you becoming a great actor and winning an Oscar. But it is too unrealistic, too far away from what you think is real. So simulating it won’t have much of an emotional impact on you. But simulations involving events like, getting a promotion at work, getting into an accident, scoring poorly in an exam are more realistic and hence activate emotional centers of our mind more often. 

>To explore how even minor changes in simulation can result in significant emotional changes,  let’s imagine something for a minute by which I mean let’s simulate something for a minute. Imagine that you are on your  way to the airport to catch a flight.  And the damn traffic delays you by 45 minutes.  It delays you enough that  you are totally expecting to miss the flight. You reach the airport and you find out that the you indeed  missed the flight by 45 minutes.  Will you be disappointed after finding that out? 

>Now let’s simulate the same situation but with a twist. You are delayed by 45 mins, totally expecting to miss the flight but when you reach the airport you find out  that you missed the flight only by 5 mins. The flight got delayed by 40 mins! How would you feel then? Would you be more disappointed than the previous simulation?  

>When I play out this simulation in my mind, I feel I would be more disappointed in the scenario where I missed it by 5 minutes.  Do you agree with me here? If so, why do you think that is?  We were expecting to miss the flight in both cases, why would we be more disappointed in the  second scenario?   Psychologists who performed an experiment with this simulation exercise we just did,  argue that this is because it’s easier for us to imagine scenarios that would save us 5 minutes. Losing by 45 mins feels to us  like a lost cause, not a lot  our imagination can realistically do with that. But 5mins? If only I had made and eaten my breakfast a little faster. If only I had not talked to my parents  before catching the cab. 

>These minor alterations that I am performing in the simulation, they are much easier for my mind to do for missed the flight by 5 minute scenario and hence the disappointment is more. Closer the simulation to actual reality,  higher the emotional impact it creates in our minds.

>But our internal emotions aren’t the only thing that good simulations have an effect on. We also like to decide how true something is about the external world based on how well that something our mind can simulate. And this tendency  of ours can turn really dangerous really quickly.


>Simulation heuristic they call it. Our tendency to feel that something is more likely to happen if we can imagine it well.  Why don’t we feel any urgency about global warming even though scientists regularly tell us that time is running out? Because we have a hard time imagining what that would look like. We haven’t experienced it before.  Why are Americans so scared of Islamic terrorism even though the death rate by domestic terrorism is way higher? Because the grandiose nature of 9/11 fundamentally changed how their minds perceive threats from religion of Islam.  It is literally much easier for them to imagine that threat, actual numbers be damned!  A  study showed that people feel catching a made up disease as more likely if the symptoms of that disease were easier to imagine but if they are told about a made-up disease with hard to imagine symptoms, they think they are less likely to get it. Imagine what that would mean for a novel virus with a unique  set of symptoms. 

>This simulation heuristic that we use,  becomes even more scary as our consumption of media can play a huge role in either elevating or  dwindling of a perceived threat of something. This is exactly why we see so much division among people today. We are all living in our bubbles consuming the cable or internet news of our liking. Media that regularly exaggerates threats and present them in a simpler way black and white way, more easy to simulate. They do it for the money because sensationalism sells but simulation heuristic completely changes the viewer’s perception of what’s actually happening in the real world.  Take this year’s biggest story for instance. I am sure you noticed that your fear of coronavirus was positively correlated with how much news you consumed about it. As soon as your favorite media diet stops providing you with covid news, you become comfortable, you become careless. Out of sight, out of mind, as the old saying goes.   In fact, in US, the right wing media deliberately downplayed covid-19 for political reasons  which naturally resulted in their viewers being more careless than the viewers of left wing media, when it came to wearing mask and social distancing. 


>And if you are someone who gets anxious regularly, there are even more serious implications  of this heuristic that you should be aware of. That amazing ability you have to simulate negative scenarios so well,  well that also makes you think that those negative scenarios will actually play out.  A study on people with clinical anxiety asked participants to simulate  bunch of negative future events. Things like you develop a disease, people will make fun of you,  you will not keep up with workload, you will lose money, the list goes on.  What the study showed was that people with clinical anxiety are good at coming up with more reasons for why something negative would happen than why it won’t.     And it’s not just that they have more reasons.  Compared to control subjects, they are also better at forming mental images of those negative events. It’s almost like an anxious person brains keeps showing red light to simulations where something bad won’t happen while only displaying green light to simulations where something bad does happen.  

>So what do we about this then? We do this simulation heuristic thing,  media is actively making it worse, anxious people seem to be doing more than normal people, so where do we go from here? Can we do somehow  avoid making this jump from playing out negative simulations in our mind to then constantly worrying about them actually happening in future? 

>One way to deal with this is to actively come up with reasons why some bad outcome won’t happen which basically means having more positive outlook.   But I think a better way to deal with this is to change our relationship with these simulations. Our mind has a strong connection between simulation centers and emotional centers. More realistic simulations result in heightened emotional response. On most occasions, you can’t help but play a negative simulation, it’s an autonomous process. So instead of pushing that simulation away, first be aware of the fact that the mind is actually playing a simulation. Just that awareness is going to be an important first step.   

>Next, you need to remind yourself of the fact that historically, your negative simulations usually turn out to be not true.  You are trying to reach your family but none of them are picking up your call. Immediately negative simulations start playing in your mind. What if this? What if that? In those anxious moments,  how often do you remind yourself that previously such negative simulations did not play out in reality? I doubt the number is greater than zero.  Remind yourself that simulation heuristic has come online and is tricking you into becoming more anxious. And just like the last episode, I cannot help but mention meditation again here.  Instead of letting us get absorbed by the story created by the simulation which then results in a strong emotional response, mindfulness meditation can help us observe the illusory nature of simulation and show how they have no basis in reality.   ~~This breaking down of simulation into smaller components will show that their are more reasonable reasons for why they aren’t picking up your call.~~  And finally, just be conscious of your media diet.  Of course, It is important to be aware of what’s happening in the world but unfortunately most of the news providers of today have very different incentives when making the news and lot of times they are not in alignment with your incentives for consuming the news. Intentionally or not, this misalignment of incentives regularly leads to a dangerous exploitation of our simulation powers

>So yeah, that’s all for today’s episode. Hopefully it helped you understand the nature of your mind a little bit more. Give a shot to some of these strategies next time you find yourself getting anxious while playing negative simulations.
