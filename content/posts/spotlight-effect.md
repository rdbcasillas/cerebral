>In late 1970s American psychologists  David Premack  and Guy Woodruff’s were interested in knowing whether chimpanzees, like humans, have the capacity to empathize and understand others.  We have this tendency to think that other people have beliefs, desires and intentions that are different from our own. And This ability pretty much underlies every aspect of humanity.  But do other animals  like chimpanzee have this ability too? 

>Premack and Woodruff wrote their findings in the influential paper titled “Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?”  “Theory of mind”. This phrase would go on to become one of the most popular concepts in psychology. What started out as an intellectual curiosity to bridge the gap between chimpanzees and humans, became much more serious when researchers started looking into neurological disorders like autism or schizophrenia and how these debilitating diseases lead to an impaired theory of mind. It turned out that People with theory of mind deficit have difficulty in determining the intentions of others and they lack an understanding of how their behavior affects others. 

>Of course, just because some diseases can cause theory of mind deficit, doesn’t mean that we are born with this capacity to understand others’ perspective. Small children also have difficulty with this. They tend to think that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do. For instance, If you ask a 4 year old boy what he would like to gift his mom for her birthday, there is a high likelihood that he would suggest Spiderman or some other action figure.    

>One of the most influential psychologist of 20th century, Jean Piaget, was also a pioneer when it came to understanding children’s cognitive development. He came up with a theory that includes four different stages of cognitive development. Each stage covers a range of child’s age. In the 2nd stage, between 2 to 7 years, Piaget noticed this struggle that children go through in understanding perspective of others.  In order to show this concretely, he did a study that included children of all ages. These children were taken for multiple walks around a tiny toy model that included mountains with bunch of little animals and trees thrown around them. After the walk, each child was seated on one side of the model, so they could see it from one angle. But on the opposite side, facing the child, they made a doll sit at the same height as the child. The child was then shown bunch of different photos and was asked to select the picture that best matched what they saw while sitting on the chair. But more importantly, they were then asked to select the picture that best matched what the doll saw from the opposite end. Of course, all the children could pick the picture that best represented what they saw but children between 4 and 6 years frequently chose the same exact picture to show the doll’s view. According to Piaget, this was because they couldn’t understand that the doll’s perspective differed from their own view.  He called this behavior as egocentrism, an inability to distinguish one’s own perspective from that of others. 

>And not surprisingly, this egocentrism doesn’t simply disappear when you stop being a small child. Adolescents and even adults continue to show egocentrism in some form or the other. So today, I would like to briefly talk about an interesting bias that can result from these lingering egocentric tendencies. 


>Imagine that you go online and buy yourself a fancy looking expensive smartwatch.  And let’s say your friend planned a get together,  so you decide to wear that watch to that event.  You reach there and after sometime you start noticing that nobody is paying any attention to your fancy watch.  Nobody is looking at it, not even making a single comment on it.  All sorts of thoughts start running in your head. Is it not a good looking watch?  Why don’t they ask me about it even once? A lot of that day is ruined by constantly wondering if you made a terrible decision in buying that expensive smartwatch. 

>Now Let’s imagine another scenario. Let’s say you are sitting in a group discussion. During the discussion, a thought, that you think is clever comes to your mind. But you don’t share it immediately, you play it in your head multiple times to make sure you say it perfectly. Finally you get a chance to speak and you let it out. And you screw up.  Or at least you feel you screwed up. You didn’t phrase it like how you played it out in your mind. In fact, when that thought came out,  it sounded too obvious. Maybe they thought I was dumb to even say that! Oh god, that was so embarrassing, you think. Rest of the discussion gets completely ruined for you by obsessing over such self conscious thoughts. 

>Social psychologists have a name for this behavior. They call it “the  spotlight effect”. Our tendency to believe that we are being noticed by people way more than we actually are. You see, we are the center of our own world, with constant access to our events playing out in our minds but sometimes we forget that we are not the center of everyone else’s world. So whenever we do something slightly atypical in front of others, we feel that they will immediately notice it or should notice it. It makes us more self conscious and we end up running all sorts of unwarranted thoughts in our minds, thoughts that increase anxiety and lower our self esteem. 


>Sometimes, the reason behind spotlight effect is not just egocentrism.  There is another interesting related concept called anchoring and adjustment which also plays some role in creating this behavior. It sounds complicated but if you break it down it is actually straightforward. Anchoring and adjustment. We use our own thinking, our own feelings about something as an anchor. We use it as an anchor because we rely too heavily on it when making future decisions or when predicting other’s thinking. So we use them as an anchor and then (and this is the important part), we don’t  correct for the fact, we don’t properly adjust for the fact that other people don’t have access to those thoughts and feelings. 

>Take the example of our group discussion I mentioned a minute ago. The person planning to share that clever thought has all these expectations they are forming in their mind about speaking that thought aloud.  Other people simply don’t have any access to any of that. They are  dealing with their own worries, their own clever thoughts. But because you created such a huge emotional anchor by raising expectations in your mind and not meeting them, you have a lot of trouble making proper adjustment to it when you are deciding what other people are thinking about the situation. 


>So next time you find yourself worrying about speaking in public or overthinking how something you said was perceived by others,  remind yourself of the spotlight effect. Remind yourself how egocentrism, the tendency to see situations only from your own perspective can create a faulty mental model of what other people are actually thinking.  Try to recognize your emotional anchor, make proper adjustments to that anchor. For instance, don’t just think  “Oh, this is how I feel about myself right now, so other people must be feeling those things about me too”. And finally, remember that people have divided attention.  Their mind doesn’t have the loads of mental space you have for your own behaviors and thoughts. It has its own set of goals and worries to think about. Other people are just too preoccupied by their own shit. 

>Ok, so that’s it for today. If you have any questions, concerns or feedbacks, write to  cerebralpodcast@protonmail.com. I will be back next week with another useful concept to enhance our thinking experience.
