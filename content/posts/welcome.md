## Transcript
>We arrive in this world with a possession that happens to be the most complex object in the known Universe. The Human brain. As long as we keep feeding ourselves and not get killed,  this electric neural forest will effortlessly grow and become more and more complex. We don’t appreciate this fact that often, do we?    The most complex object in the known universe is sitting right on our shoulders.  I hope people reflected more often on what that entails.  
 
>Now of course we do like to celebrate our intellectual achievements. Like coming up with complex math equations to understand the forces governing the Universe . Or discovering Evolution and Genetics to understand forces governing Life itself. 
 
>But instead of celebrating The Human Brain that enabled these discoveries, we usually end up celebrating the humans or intellectual movements that led to these discoveries. By doing this, we overlook the fact that we possess an equally complex object capable of p  ulling off  similar fascinating discoveries.
 
>I think this is a big problem. It's a problem because when we stop  appreciating the complexity of our own minds, we stop paying attention to its wonderful flexibility, it’s inherent but conquerable built-in flaws. And as a result, fail to exploit the full potential of our minds. 
 
>This lack of interest with our own mind is quite understandable. The evolutionary processes that led us here, didn’t give a damn that minds pay attention to itself. In the game of life, all that matters is to use this mind to survive long enough to have babies, to pass on our genes. So the challenges of surviving in the wild, shaped our nervous system as much as it shaped the nervous system of any other animal.
 
>But we now live in different times. Lions aren't chasing us anymore. Neighboring tribes aren’t trying to slaughter us for resources.  Today, we are dealing with a different set of challenges. Challenges that primarily manifest in intangible forms. Challenges that curiously enough, live and grow within the confines of our own minds. And the problem is that we are largely incompetent in dealing with challenges of this nature. I believe that this incompetence is the root cause of many social ills that face us today. Soaring division among people, rise  of superstition and conspiracy,  corruption and ineptitude among our leaders. And most importantly, the explosion of mental health challenges across the globe.

>It is quite a tragedy, that our education systems don't put any emphasis on understanding our minds or discussing how we think. One needs to go get a degree in Psychology for that. Neither we get any training to become better at the act of thinking itself. The incentives in our education systems are designed to discourage qualities of the mind like curiosity, skepticism, introspection. Instead, those incentives are designed to make people better at blindly   following authority. They are designed to make people desire better grades. They are designed to get better jobs. 
 
>So that’s where this podcast comes in.  I want to get people excited about different concepts and frameworks that I believe will not only help us in appreciating and understanding our minds better but also guide us towards better ways of thinking. Good thinking is hard but it can also be a lot of fun if you possess a powerful set of tools to do it. In this podcast, We will cover insights from fields like cognitive and social psychology, go over the fascinating field of heuristic and biases to understand the mind's built-in flaws and learn the art of instrumental rationality to help us achieve our goals more efficiently.

>Depending on the complexity of the concept, each episode will be about 5 to 15 min long and will cover one single concept that I feel will enhance our thinking experience. And just like with any skill, this skill of enhancing our thinking will require practice. So instead of just making you passively listen, I will try to actively involve you in this journey by often asking questions and assigning problems.  My hope is to not make this podcast into a set of boring short lectures but instead get you excited about these concepts so you can go out in the world (including the internal world of your mind) and observe it more clearly with a different set of lenses.

>So yeah, that's it for now. The name of the podcast is Cerebral. I am excited about this and I hope you consider joining me in this adventurous  journey into our minds while expanding our thinking toolkit.
