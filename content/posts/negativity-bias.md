>Good and Bad. Almost every animal on this planet is in some way familiar with this oldest dichotomy motivating life. Existence of biological life literally depends on its ability to distinguish between good and bad. All of our emotions and behaviors are in some way connected to these binary glasses through which we scan this world. The greatest human struggle, to create universal moral codes, to throw everything that life throws at us,  into the buckets of Good and Bad, has manifested itself in the form of hundreds, if not thousands of religions in our brief existence on this planet.   It’s a never ending struggle, which will exist as long as there are humans in this Universe. 

>But are these two characters in this dichotomy equal in strength? When applied in equal intensity, do Good and Bad equally affect us and the world around us? Or Is one more powerful than the other? Could it be that Bad is simply stronger than Good? 

>In this episode of Cerebral, we will explore negativity bias, the notion that negativity triumphs positivity. Something that is positive has a lesser impact on our behavior than something that is equal in intensity,  but negative. 

>In 1971, Philip Brickman and Donald Campbell presented an article in a conference,  that gave birth to the phrase “hedonic treadmill”. They argued that despite big positive or negative events or changes in life, humans tend to quickly return to a stable level of [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness). We have a happiness set point, they said. A set point that everyone returns to even after a significantly emotional life event. 

>So what was their basis for saying this?  Well, at the time they didn’t have a lot of evidence to support this. But few years later, they published some data. Data collected from interviews.  They measured the happiness levels of three different groups of people,  by interviewing them. In the first group were the people who had won the lottery a year ago, second group had people who were paralyzed because of an accident, which also happened a year before the interview. And the third group was just the control group.  

>They asked these groups a bunch of questions to asses their happiness levels while performing daily activities. What they found was that people who had won the lottery, even though agreed that their lives had improved,  did not report higher levels of everyday happiness than the control group. In fact the control group’s everyday happiness was slightly higher. Apparently, the euphoria over the lottery win did not last after a while and the everyday happiness levels quickly returned to what they had been before they won the lottery. Same was true for the group with accident victims. They too felt that their lives in general had worsen but when it came to everyday activities, there was no difference compared to control. It seems like everyday happiness returned to a set point even for the people who underwent a horrible tragedy. 

>But what was also interesting, was that, these accident victims were much slower to adapt to their new fate than the lottery winners. By that I mean that these people continued to compare their current situation with how their lives had been before the accident. This was in stark contrast to lottery winners who did not spend much time thinking how their lives had significantly improved compared what it was before winning lottery. 

>So even though there was a return to normal level of happiness in both cases, this return  took a lot more time for negative life events compared to the positive ones. In this case,  Bad outcome seems to have exerted more influence than the good outcome. 

>There is a problem with this study though. How do we really compare winning lottery and becoming paraplegic as equal events on opposite ends of happiness spectrum? If we have a scale of happiness from -10 to +10, can we really say that an accident that makes you paralyzed is -10 and winning lottery is +10? That kinda sounds ridiculous, right? 

>So how about we objectively try to make the good and bad equal? This is exactly what behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amol Tversky tried when they were studying our psychology on dealing with losses. They asked people to perform thought experiments involving money. In one of their thought experiment, they asked their subjects to imagine a coin toss.  Actually I will let Daniel Kahneman explain it. 

>So what Kahneman and Tversky found was that people don’t see losing X dollars as equal to gaining X dollars.  For instance, You are way more upset about losing $50 than you are happy about gaining $50.  Losses loom larger than gains in our minds. In other words, Bad exerts more power on us than equal amounts of good. 

>Even in close relationships, negative interactions seem to be upstaging positive interactions when it comes to relationship satisfaction. Studies using videotaped couples, found that presence or absence of negative behaviors in a relationship are more strongly correlated with the quality of couple’s relationship than presence or absence of positive behaviors. Which is a more complex way of saying that for sustaining a healthy relationship, increasing positive behaviors will be somewhat less effective than decreasing negative behaviors. John Gottman who did quite a lot of work on relationships, proposed a diagnostic index for evaluating relationships. His conclusion: for a relationship to succeed, positive or good interactions must outnumber negative or bad interactions by at least 5 to 1! If the ratio falls below that, the relationship is likely to fail. 

>What about forming impressions? Do we really need some research to tell us that negative traits about people stand out more than positive traits when we are trying to form an impression of them?  A person can be doing ten good things but a single harmful act of dishonesty or corruption has the potential to completely destroy their reputation in our minds.   And we don’t just do this for individual people, we do it for whole groups of people when forming stereotypes about them.  Negative stereotypes are usually easier to form and harder to shed than positive ones.   Here’s how a paper summarized this whole situation around impressions,  bad reputations are easy to acquire but difficult to lose and good reputations are difficult to acquire but easy to lose. 


>And think about your own self? Think about how negative feedbacks from other people or negative self talk can derail your mental health so easily. Yes, positive feedbacks do help us feel good about ourselves but they just don’t have the same intensity or power on our minds.  If you get five positive feedbacks in a day and a single negative one, what does your mind do? Does it not focus on that single negative feedback way more than it should? 

>I can just go on and on with examples in different domains but we need to pause and reflect for a moment.  Why is it that bad is stronger than good? Why does negativity has stronger influence over us than positivity? 

>As with almost everything else in life, we will have to knock on Evolution’s door for this explanation also.  Imagine that you are a caveman living in a jungle,  just trying to make a living in the wild. You are going about your business, looking for some food to have for lunch. This hunt for food is not very successful and you come back home empty handed. No lunch for that day. Later that day your neighbor tells you that they found a goldmine of food, around the same region you were hunting in. Sudden regret washes over you. How did I miss it? You had a possibility of a positive outcome, in this case grabbing a wholesome lunch,  and you ignored it. It was regretful, you felt little sad for a while but nothing too terrible happened. 
>But let’s say instead of ignoring precious food, you somehow ignored a tiger observing you,  while you were hunting? What will be the outcome of that? That’s right, a quick one way trip right into tiger’s stomach. Ignoring a danger of this kind, even once completely wipes you out from this planet. 

>So it seems like survival of an animal requires immediate and urgent attention to bad outcomes but it is less urgent and less immediate, when it comes to good outcomes. Which means that psychologically, it is (or at least it was back in the day),  more adaptive to be responding more strongly to bad outcomes than good ones. 

>Other than this evolutionary reason, it is also possible that humanity’s overall progress is best facilitated by having bad events have a lasting impact on our psyche while keeping impacts of good events temporary.  If good feelings were more permanent, maybe we will be less motivated to make progress? 

>Of course just because all this was potentially true for our ancestors, doesn’t mean it is true for us in the modern world. Those are just reasons why evolution came up with negativity bias,  not reasons for why it is still useful. Negativity bias make us more anxious, more sad and yes,  more negative about our lives. By dwelling on negative events and behaviors, people end up falling into this  abyss of insecurity, anger and bitterness. We become more pessimistic about other people and society.

>So the question is,  if we are wired to be biased towards negativity, how do we overcome it? 
>There are a few promising solutions that we should consider giving a shot. As I have mentioned before, first we need to be aware and notice when we start this pattern of negative thinking. Once you are in the habit of noticing it, try to create a tiny habit to break this pattern. Maybe Clean some part of your house, start a 5 min timer and do some exercise or meditation, whatever small activity that you can think of, that gives you tiny satisfaction after having finished it.   In a future podcast, I will talk about  creating such habits using a strategy called Trigger Action Plans.
 
>Another strategy is to try to calm down the negative voice by treating that voice as your friend. Your job is to understand that friend. Why are they being so negative today? Are they scared or angry about something? Be a good friend to that negative voice. Try to give that voice an advice you would give to a good friend. 

>And finally, try to end your day by noting or highlighting positive things in your life. Gratitude journalling, an activity in which you write down couple of things in your life that you are grateful for or couple of joyful events like a making or eating a delicious meal or helping someone else.  Gratitude journal has been shown to be quite effective in reducing stress, helping us sleep better and improving our relationships.  It has also been shown to help you become less materialistic and more generous towards other people. 

>So yes, bad can be stronger than good and yes we are wired to see it that way. But fortunately human brain is quite flexible and allows us to overcome this evolutionary hand that we have been dealt. We can overcome it by modifying our existing thinking habits, by being gentle and friendly with that negative voice in our head  or by creating new habits like keeping a gratitude journal. In this oldest struggle with Bad, Good needs a helping hand and we are the only species of animal up for the task. Hope you consider preparing yourself for it.
