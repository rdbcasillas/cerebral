## Transcript

>‘Don't judge a book by its cover’,  Despite this famous old saying , facial cues almost always guide our first impressions. In fact, Human societies consistently put attractive people on a high pedestal. Research after research has shown that attractive people, on average are considered more kind and more intelligent than unattractive people. They are considered more altruistic and are perceived as being more moral. You, are more likely to help a person if they happen to dress neatly and look attractive to you,  compared to someone in equal need but less attractive and well kept. And here's the most scary finding of all: Judges and juries are more lenient when handing out punishments or convictions to attractive defendants,  when they commit the exact same crimes as unattractive defendants . 

>Is it really surprising then that our society is obsessed with looking beautiful? Even if no one has read any research on this topic, everyone knows how useful it is to look attractive or how looking unattractive can actively work against you in all walks of life. 
>But why is this true about us humans? Why do we take one positive quality about someone and let it influence our judgment on them in all the other domains? Today in cerebral, we will explore “The halo effect”, a cognitive bias that not only makes attractive people more successful in life, but also allows various businesses and organizations, to exploit our psyche, by making their product or whatever they are selling, seem more valuable than it actually is. 

>Whenever someone tells me that they buy only organic food, my bullshit detector goes off. My mind listens to whatever they say further with extra bit of skepticism. One can even argue that I am biased against people who are organic food evangelist. Why is that? Isn’t organic food cleaner and more healthy? Not really. There is just no evidence that organic food is healthier than conventional food. A 2012 meta-analysis from Stanford analyzed 240 studies and found no evidence that nutrient levels or pesticide contaminations are significantly different between organic and conventional foods. They also didn’t find any particular health benefits by consuming organic foods over conventional foods. Organic or not, just eat your fruits and vegetables regularly. 

>So why am I talking about organic foods?  Well, it turns out that due to this prevalent perception that organic means healthier,  companies have started stamping “organic” labels on their products to make them seem more healthy. And it is not just the perception organic equals healthier that they exploit.  In 2013,   Researchers from Cornell University asked participants to evaluate 3 pairs of products, 2 yogurts, cookies and potatoe chips. Even though all 6 items were organic, only one of each pair was labelled “organic”. The study found that people find items labeled organic as more tasty and having less calories. People were even happy to pay 23% more for organic labelled products. 

>Halo effect. If our mind has a positive association with something, it starts creating other unwarranted positive associations without any evidence. In food marketing, this phenomenon is called "health halo". Even unhealthy products can be marketed and then accepted as healthy, if they are within the halo of an organic product or sold by a company that is famous for selling organic foods. 

>Since it is an innate human bias, naturally food industry is no the only industry exploiting it. Halo effect has also been consistently used by automotive industry. Car manufacturers regularly develop so called "halo cars", which are primarily released as a publicity stunt to increase the overall brand value. In this case, The hope is that the halo around these cars will be large enough resulting in an increase in sale of regular cars by the same brand. 

>These tactics by profit seeking companies  are usually intentional. They know exactly what they are doing. But what about the unintentional behaviors caused by this bias?  Some of the most sinister effects of halo effect are seen in our education system. Back in 1973, Clifford and Walster did a study on teachers in which they gave the teachers report cards of 5th grade students along with  a photo of the student. Teachers were asked to complete an opinion sheet that required them to indicate their best estimate, their best guess,  of answer to multiple questions like "what is the child's IQ?" , "what is the child's relationship with his or her peers?", what is the parents interest like in child's academic achievement and what is the child's future potential in education. They found  that the teacher's  expectations on all four measures were much higher for the attractive child than the unattractive child. In short, Teachers expected attractive kids in 5th grade to be more intelligent, more social and to perform better in life than kids who were less attractive."

>Another set of researchers interviewed teachers individually,  reading them a statement about a child along with showing them child's picture. They then asked teachers to indicate how they felt the child would most likely do in the classroom. Again, attractive students were perceived to perform better in classrooms than unattractive students.  

>If you are still following me, you might be wondering "how did the researchers decide which kid is attractive and which kid is not? " In such studies, researchers use a method called "truth of consensus" for rating attractiveness. They involve multiple people who look at the same set of photographs. If majority of these judges rate a photograph as high, moderate or low in physical attractiveness, then that person is placed in that category. Moderate category is usually ignored because high and low attractiveness categories have higher agreements and therefore more useful.  This simple method has its limitations but it seems to work well because research has shown that beauty is not entirely subjective. There are some specific features in human face that pretty much all of us find attractive. 

>One place you would hope this bias to not have a stronghold is in our justice systems. Unfortunately, things are pretty bad there too. Downs and Lyons conducted a study to find  a link between a criminal’s attractiveness and sentencing outcomes. They asked a group of police officers and students (across different race and gender) to rate the attractiveness of over 2000 criminals. A scale of 1 - 5 was used and their ratings were mostly similar. Judges sentencing decisions were divided into two main categories: misdemeanors and felonies. For misdemeanours, the judges punished  unattractive criminals with significantly larger fines than attractive criminals. And here's the most crazy part, the find was inversely proportional to attractiveness. Which means that fines incrementally increased as the attractiveness decreased. 

>Another research gathered data on 67 defendants who were already sentenced. The defendants were a mix of black, Hispanic, and white and there were 15 real judges. This research found that on average , criminals of low attractiveness were sentenced to 4.10 years in prison and criminals of high attractiveness were sentenced to 1.87 years in prison. That is 120% increase in prison time. Depressing stuff. 

>Once you start noticing it, this bias shows up everywhere. And as with all biases, halo bias can also be explained in terms of a useful feature of our mind. Our minds are using a very simple heuristic, a mental shortcut to make predictions about something or someone. Since it would take precious resources like time and energy to accurately get the full picture about an object in consideration, it is using first impression as a guide to form future judgements about that object. This may work for extreme behaviors like when evaluating future behaviors of someone who just cheated you or someone who helped save your life. But unfortunately, in the modern world this old useful feature, acts as a bug way more often, making our judgement machinery much less trustworthy. 

>So is there a way to avoid halo bias? Knowing about it and its disastrous consequences is definitely a start. Maybe try to reserve judgement on people and things that look superficially attractive or unattractive. Just Patiently collect more information before you come to any conclusion. I don't want to be biased against attractive people or people with brilliant communication skills but we do need to be little bit cautious when dealing with them. Their first impressions can be really good which ends up biasing our minds when it comes to evaluating them further. I am not arguing here that we need to look at them with skeptical eyes. But knowing this bias's great power over us, we just need to pause and collect more data before forming concrete impressions about them. 

>Also, try to reserve judgements or forming impressions about people when you are in a great mood. An interesting study from 2011 showed that people who are in good mood tend to be more vulnerable to halo effect than people in negative mood. 

>And finally, I should mention the most obvious advice, notice how exhausted you are when you are judging people.  Halo effect or for that matter any cognitive bias definitely looms large when you lack the mental energy to think clearly and therefore rely on your mind's automatic processing. 

>So that's all I have for this episode. I will be back next week with another thinking trap. As always, for any concerns, questions or feedback, write to cerebralpodcast@protonmail.com. Until next time, have fun thinking.
