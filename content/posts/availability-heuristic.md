## Transcript

>Welcome to Cerebral, a podcast where we explore ideas from psychology and cognitive science to build an accurate mental model of a complicated world.  If I ask you what are the odds that in the next ten years, the world will experience another pandemic,  that will kill millions of people, what would you say? Something tells me that you would assign higher odds to that possibility compared to odds you would have assigned if I had asked the same question in 2019. We are still in the middle of a pandemic. Currently,  our mind has a heightened sense of danger from viruses than just over a year ago. Objectively though, the threat of a virus destabilizing the world was always there. Experts  had been predicting for years that a new global pandemic is imminent. Even famous philanthropist Bill Gates warned us back in 2015: 

>But nobody took them seriously. Why is that? How do we decide which threats are worth freaking out about?  Why do we over-react to threats like terrorism while under-reacting to climate change or viruses ?  

>Today in Cerebral, we will explore availability heuristic or availability bias, a mental shortcut that we use for thinking about likelihoods, about the chances of something happening in the world. We will look at how this heuristic paints an incorrect picture of reality in our minds, screwing up our top priorities and leaving us not only grossly unprepared for looming dangers but also extremely vulnerable to mass propaganda. 

>From 2005 to 2015, over 300,000 Americans were killed by guns. Only 94 were killed by Islamic terrorists. Americans of course, fear the latter way more than the former. In order to understand where this irrational fear comes from, we need to go back to 1970s and look at one of the first experiments done to understand the phenomenon behind this kind of fear. 
>Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two researchers you will hear a lot of, in this podcast, asked their subjects the following question: 
    >- If a random word is taken from an English text, is it more likely that the word starts with a K (like Keep, Kitchen, Kiwi), or that K is the third letter in that word? (like ask or acknowledge)"

>You can pause the podcast here to think for a minute. What do you think? Words like Keep, Kitchen, Kiwi are more common or words like ask, acknowledge? 

>Not surprisingly, in that particular study,  participants overestimated the number of words that began with the letter "K" and underestimated the number of words that had "K" as the third letter.

>But it turns out that a typical sentence in English contains twice as many words that have "K" as the third letter than "K" as the first letter.  And overall, there are three times more words with "K" in the third position than words that begin with "K".

>Kahneman and Tversky argued that people would immediately think of many words that begin with the letter "K" but that it would take them a lot more effort to think of any words in which "K" is the third letter. They said that people answer questions like these by comparing the availability of the two categories in their memory. If one category is more readily available, people think that is more likely. That's why they called it "availability heuristic". 

>This is exactly why Americans fear Islamic terrorists more than guns. American media usually covers rare stories around Islamic terrorists more frequently and more sensationally than gun shootings. Death by guns is so common that it doesn't make for entertaining Television. Moreover, A  study found that even though between 2008 to 2012,  only 6% of terrorist acts were committed by Muslims, 81% of terrorists on TV news were portrayed as Muslims. K and T  called this phenomenon "frequency of repetition". More an instance is repeated within a category, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. In this case, even though the "instance" of a specific type of terrorism is not repeating regularly in the real world, this "instance" is disproportionally covered in the media and therefore it irrationally increases the fear in minds of people consuming that media.  

>This is also what happens with so many stereotypes. If I tell you that "I saw a famous Astronaut today" or "I met a famous chess player ", your mind will likely imagine me meeting a person who is male, simply because male chess players and astronauts are the examples more readily available in our minds.

>So ease of recall due to more examples of a particular category is one reason behind availability bias. 

>But there is another factor that affects this bias. Exemplars are examples that stand out more than other examples during the process of recall. Our minds are very good at capturing interesting things in the data and subsequently storing them better than mundane things. 

>For instance, let's say you go out on a vacation. And let's say this vacation involves a long boat trip. During this trip, you come across sharks, dolphins, fish of different kinds. After a couple of weeks of this trip,  if I were to ask you how many sharks and how many dolphins you saw, your mind would assume a higher ratio of shark in the water,  even if in reality, you came across higher number of dolphins. Why? Magnificent sharks have a greater impact on our memory while our mind gets used to bunch of dolphins swimming around. 

>This exaggeration is something we all do on regular basis when recalling stories from our past. Our memory underscores out of ordinary events and therefore can create an incorrect movie of what actually happened. Exemplars are the events or behaviors,  that our memory not only stores, but also underscores and highlights.  So when we recall, naturally underscored and highlighted things are recalled more easily.  And this is another major reason behind availability bias. 

>So as we always ask in this podcast, what can we do about this bias? This mental shortcut exists for a reason and one can imagine why it is sometimes useful even today. So we don't want to discard it completely. But we do need to be on a lookout for what Kuran and Sunstein call "availability entrepreneurs". These are people or organizations that try to invest resources into promoting a belief or ideology in order to derive personal benefit.  Politicians, ideological news media and fake news websites on the internet,  regularly bombard us with well crafted propaganda via vivid images which creates an unreal map of the world in our minds. Our opinions are often formed by examples that we can recall best but if the examples themselves are cherry picked or exaggerated, how can we expect our opinions or beliefs to be anywhere near truth?  So be on a lookout for availability entrepreneurs that are selling their cherished beliefs, beliefs that are competing with one another in a sort of "availability market" within our minds. 

>Other than that, when evaluating behavior of others, notice how negative behaviors tend to get recalled more easily than positive behaviors. This is something I talked about in the episode on negativity bias. This bias towards negativity (which can be easier to recall), can lead to incorrect judgement about someone's personality. This is especially true if the recall happens when you are down or in bad mood. Negative mood tends to boost the availability bias and makes our memory much less reliable than usual. 

>So yeah, that's it for this episode of Cerebral. I hope that this brief intro on availability heuristic was useful and will help you see some of the events that you recall in your mind with a different lens. As always, if you have any concerns, questions of feedback, write to cerebralpodcast@protonmail.com. In the next episode, we will do something different. We will take a break from learning about biases and enter the fascinating land of instrumental rationality. Thank you for listening, until next time, have fun thinking!
