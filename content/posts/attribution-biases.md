## Transcript

  >We often wonder why other people think or behave in a certain way. Why is Sanjay always bringing up climate change with everyone he meets? Is it because he reads a lot and is genuinely alarmed by the consequences of global warming? Or is he simply trying to grab attention and perform some sort of virtue signaling?  I wonder why Sheila ignored me in the elevator today? Did I do something to piss her off or is she having a stressful day? 

  >Since this kind of thinking is all so common,  it isn't surprising that the field of Psychology has a lot to say about it. Attribution, that's the fancy name for it.  Set of mental processes that we use to understand why people behave the way they do. 
  >(music starts)Today in Cerebral,  we will briefly explore the topic of attribution and look into some of the thinking traps that we regularly fall prey to when applying attribution. 

  >For decades now, psychologists have been passionately arguing about attribution by publishing their own pet theory on how it works. Fundamentally though, most of them are trying to explain this: how do we come up with different reasons behind other people's behavior.  (another music starts) It all started with Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider, the so called "Father of Attribution Theory". Heider simplified this concept for us by contrasting attribution in two flavors: Internal and External. 

  >You notice a reckless driver speeding past a bunch of cars dangerously. "What a jerk. What a crazy guy" you think. Nicely done!   By assigning the driver's reckless behavior to an internal trait, in this case of being a jerk, you have successfully applied the Internal attribution. But if you are the kind of person who worriedly thought "Wow, that person must be in some emergency", that will qualify as external attribution. External situations, outside of driver's control, were the root cause of their reckless behavior. 

  >So how do we choose between Internal and External attributions? It turns out that this choice can depend on factors that aren't always consciously available to us.  For instance, in US, when it comes to assigning attribution to social problems like poverty, crime or homelessness, people who associate themselves with conservatism, tend to assign more blame to individual habits and behaviors of people suffering from those social ills.   But if they think of themselves as liberals, they prefer focusing on situational explanations like systemic injustice. This is also why you see liberals being are more comfortable with Govt. assistance as they tend to believe the person ended up homeless due to no fault of their own.

  >Even different parenting styles while growing up can also have an affect on our attribution choice. Children with authoritative parents (parents who can be quite demanding and have high expectations from their kids)are more likely to think about personality traits when it comes to causes behind social problems. 

  >But irrespective of parenting style or ideology, there are some attribution traps that most of us can fall prey to. To highlight this, let me request you to indulge me with couple of imagination exercises.

  >Imagine that you are asked to participate in an experiment. In this experiment, you get to read an article. An article that is supportive of death penalty. You are also told that the opinions in this article are author's own opinions. So nobody forced them to write in one way or the other.  Ok, you read it.  Now you are asked to read an article against death penalty. But this time,  you are told that the author had no choice in the matter.  They were directed to write it that way by someone else. So you read that too.  Now if I ask you : What do you think are author's own opinion in either cases?   What would you say? You can pause the podcast and reflect for a moment. It's simple, isn't it. Of course the article supporting death penalty are author's own opinion whereas the article against death penalty is someone else's opinion, right?  Here's the crazy part though. Participants in a similar experiment did not think so. Actually, In both cases,  they thought that the content in the article matched author's own opinions. How can this be? They were literally told that they were directed to write it that way by someone else? 

  >Let's do one more imagination exercise. Let's imagine a mock quiz show.  For this, we will randomly pick 5 people to be quizmasters and 5 to be contestants. Quizmasters get to pick and choose  whatever questions they like including the ones they know the answers to.  Each quizmaster then gets to ask their questions to a single contestant. Your job is to just watch this quizshow 5 times. So imagine sitting in audience and watching it play out.  What You notice is that in all five instances, the contestants performed quite poorly on the quiz. If I now ask you: "Who do you smarter? The quizmaster or the contestant? " , what would you say? Remember, all participants performed quite poorly. You can pause the podcast to think about this too. 

  >Ok, after having seen all contestants performed poorly, who do you imagine being smarter? If you thought quizmaster, then you are definitely not alone. This is exactly what most participants of an actual experiment thought. But remember I told you that quizmaster chose whatever questions they wanted to? This information was clearly given to participants but their brains decided to ignore it.   What's even stranger is that even the contestants thought that quizmaster was smarter than them. So what's going on here? 

  >There seems to be a systematic error in our thinking when it comes to attribution. We seem to be going for internal attribution even when external attributions are made so damn clear. Social psychologists call this Fundamental Attribution Error. Our tendency to over-emphasize personality traits over situational factors. We love playing the game of drawing inference about someone's personality from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur. 

  >I am sure you can imagine many instances when you came to a quick conclusion about someone's   ill intent, only to realize later that external situations outside of their control played  a huge role in why they behaved the way they did.  

  >Whats funny is that, when it comes to our own negative actions, we are quick at finding all sorts of situational factors. They are not losing weight because they are lazy or are not motivated. But I am not able to create the meditation habit because I can't find any time in my busy schedule. That person was driving recklessly because they are a bad driver. I had to drive like that because I am getting really late for my meeting.  This is what psychologists refer to as actor-observer bias. This one gets turned up to eleven, especially when we the actor is someone we are not very fond but if that actor performing negative behavior is you or someone you are close with (a friend of a family member), it is much easier to think about situational factors. 

  >So what is the point of knowing about all this? Well, it is clearly a problem if you regularly make mistakes while judging someone's reason for doing something. It can lead to dangerous misunderstandings, pointless arguments and just a lot of mental noise. My hope is that armed with an understanding about these attribution traps, we can try be more careful in our thinking and maybe more compassionate when judging others. 

  >It surely isn't easy to undo the mental wiring that we have strengthened throughout our lives but there is some good news. A study from Univ of London recently found that mindfulness meditation can decrease the instances in which we fall prey to attribution biases. People who did mindful meditation were better at taking situational factors into account. 

  >If you feel meditation is too much work for you, here's a mental heuristic that I suggest you try next time you find yourself applying attribution. Notice you are judging someone's behavior and immediately ask yourself if you are being fair in taking into  account some possible external attributions for that behavior.  

  >Don't run with the first reason that comes to your mind for their negative behavior. This is easier to do if you love or care for that person but becomes a lot harder if you don't care for them or already have negative memories associated with them. But only practicing it will make it easier over time. And as time passes, verify these attribution assignment experiments. Were your first intuitions right about the person or did it make more sense to wait for some data to see what external situations were affecting their behavior?  

  >I think trying this heuristic should be an interesting experience for your mind. It's quite possible that   regularly thinking in this way will avoid unnecessary stress that we humans are so prone to by gravitating towards the very first reason that our mind conjurs up for someone's negative behavior. 

  >Ok, so that's it for today. Join me next week to explore another pattern in our thinking that can lead to regular errors. If you have any questions, feedbacks or concerns about this show, you can reach out to me cerebral@protonmail.com.
